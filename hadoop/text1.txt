Hope you are well . I have a PhD in applied mathematics specializing in fluid mechanics from the University of Manchester. My thesis focused on unsteady boundary-layers, stability, and flow control.  I have 8 yrs of experience in working with  PDEs, mathematical modeling, optimization, and scientific computing.  I'm actively looking for opportunities to start work as soon as possible.  Please note, I'm a Green card holder and do not need any work sponsorship.
I recently worked as a software developer at ANSYS developing the discrete adjoint solver. The software development is done in both serial and Parallel environment. I implemented gradient-based algorithms into their solver. I also worked on the topology optimization taking ideas from your articles on that topic. I worked on the following test cases to test the technology
Optimial design of an aerofoil for drag reduction
 Optimal design of the front wing of the F1 car to maximize downforce to drag ratio  Optimal design of the sedan to reduce the drag force
